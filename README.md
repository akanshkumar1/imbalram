Hey! I'm Balram! 👋🏻 I'm an aspiring data scientist dedicated to finding insights in data as well as educating others in data analytics! Let's connect!
 My linkendln-: (https://www.linkedin.com/in/balram-thakur-49ba14191/)

📊 I was unknown about everying about data science till i have started working on, i have sarted from python and today learning deep learning with high energy.

🔬 Fast forward to now, I am currently pursuing my Bacholr’s at IMS ghaziabad University courses campus working on AI an algorithm for data science. I took up a intermediate  Machine Learning course to understand better how to use it for my research. This is when I got formally introduced to the world of Data Science. 

💻 Always eager to learn new things and taking up new challenges, currently I'm taking up various online courses and participating in hackathons to gain experience in the field of data science and data analytics. I am also exploring multiple domains to further enhance my skills and choose where I want to end up in the future.

🙂 A little about my personality: I am the type of person who will ask “What can I do to help and improve?” when presented with a problem and will pitch in whenever needed to find out of box solutions to existing processes. I am energized by collaborating with other people to find solutions and implementing them to see improvement. I strongly believe in giving back to society and uplift everyone around me.

😎 Keeping data science aside, I love to cook and reading bok in my free time. During this summer, I learned digital marketing to add new skills . I also did two month internship in this summer(2019) as customer relationship management specialist at Siv aircon Ghaziabad

💬 Message me to talk about: how to get started in data science, what resources I am using to learn data science, and how to stay motivated when you are self-learning even if you aren’t from a computer science background.

I aspire to learn and add value at the same time. So come let's grow together. Thank you for viewing my profile. Email me at thakurbalram847409@gmail.com

I'm the type of person who will ask **“What can I do to help and improve?”** when presented with a problem and will pitch in whenever needed to find out of box solutions to existing processes. I'm energized by collaborating with other people to find solutions and implementing them to see production improvement. 
Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ Breaking down large chunk of work to managable bits.-->
