Hey! I'm Balram! 👋🏻 I'm an aspiring data scientist dedicated to finding insights in data as well as educating others in data analytics! Let's connect!

📊 I was first introduced to the world of Data Analytics while working as a control engineer in the energy sector for a Fortune 500 company. Although, at that time, the term Data science wasn’t this famous. Nonetheless, I understood that any industry generated a lot of data and not tapping into them is a waste of valuable insights. I used automation and generated insights using Excel at that time.

🔬 Fast forward to now, I am currently pursuing my Master’s at McGill University working on developing an algorithm for non-linear system estimation. I took up a graduate-level Machine Learning course to understand better how to use it for my research. This is when I got formally introduced to the world of Data Science. 

💻 Always eager to learn new things and taking up new challenges, currently I'm taking up various online courses and participating in hackathons to gain experience in the field of data science and data analytics. I am also exploring multiple domains to further enhance my skills and choose where I want to end up in the future.

🙂 A little about my personality: I am the type of person who will ask “What can I do to help and improve?” when presented with a problem and will pitch in whenever needed to find out of box solutions to existing processes. I am energized by collaborating with other people to find solutions and implementing them to see improvement. I strongly believe in giving back to society and uplift everyone around me.

😎 Keeping data science aside, I love to sketch in my free time. During this summer, I learned Adobe Illustrator to learn a new skill and add to my arsenal. I also love working with Da Vinci Resolve to edit videos and aspire to create content in the future. (only used it to create videos for some friends.) 

💬 Message me to talk about: how to get started in data science, what's it like pursuing master’s at McGill or in Canada, what resources I am using to learn data science, and how to stay motivated when you are self-learning even if you aren’t from a computer science background.

I aspire to learn and add value at the same time. So come let's grow together. Thank you for viewing my profile. Email me at thakurbalram847409@gmail.com

I'm energized by collaborating with other people to find solutions and implementing them to see production improvement. 
Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ Breaking down large chunk of work to managable bits.-->
